# Introduction
This section describes the data used for completing the final project of the Big Data Specialization by University of California San Diego on Coursera. The project focuses on developing recommendations for increasing revenue in a fictitious online game called "Catch the Pink Flamingo". 

The data for the project consists of 8 files with data on in-app purchases, ad clicks and game-specific information as well as 6 files with chat data.  The data were downloaded from the Coursera website.  All the data for the project were generated by a development team of data scientists.  The data were designed to simulate many aspects of game play and in-game user activity.  

The project entails classification analysis by fitting a decision tree and cluster analysis using k-means.  It also uses graph analytics to identify the chattiest users / teams, longest conversations and active user groups. 

The analysis in this project was performed using Python, Spark, KNIME and Neo4j.

# Description of Catch The Pink Flamingo Online Game
One of the products of an imaginary company Eglence Inc. is a highly popular mobile game called “Catch The Pink Flamingo”. The objective of the game is to catch as many Pink Flamingos as possible by following the missions provided by real-time prompts in the game and cover the map provided for each level. The levels get more complicated in mission speed and map complexity as the users move from level to level.

It’s a multi-user game where the players have to catch Pink Flamingos that randomly pop up on a gridded world map based on missions that change in real-time. For the player or team to move to the next complexity level, they need to have at least one point in every map grid cell, i.e., cover the whole world map. An example mission would be “Catch the Flamingos on land with stars on their belly” in which the player should only click on flamingos that match the mission criteria, in this case, stars and being on land. If the player tags any other flamingo on the map, he/she or his/her team gets a negative point (-1) on that map location.

After the initial sign up, a player (user) is asked to play the Level 1 individually without joining any team. This is where the user gets trained as a player and starts building a game history. Level 1 is an easy entry to the game composed of only 64 (8x8) grid cells and longer, more obvious, fun missions. Upon completion of Level 1, the player gets asked if she/he wants to join any team or form a team and will continue the rest of the time as a team player even if that means the user is a 1-person team of her/his own.

At the beginning of each level, the game creates a brand new map with more cells than the level before. The complexity of the missions also increases. The missions change more frequently as the levels increase.

The players keep in touch via chat boards assigned to the teams and also via social media, e.g., Twitter.

There are some things to consider while designing an information system for this game:

- Ranking of Users: Each user will be ranked individually by the speed and accuracy of their click to completion. The rankings get tracked in real-time and can be viewed both via the mobile app and the website for the game. In addition to score, speed and accuracy based ranking, the other players can see what parts of the map the user has the most points for. The players are also categorized based on their history as “rising star”, “veteran”, “coach”, “social butterfly” and “hot flamingo”. These refer to the qualities of players in addition to the game statistics.
- Ranking of Teams: The teams are ranked publicly. There is a maximum of 30 members in a team and a minimum of 1 member. The players “ask” to join a team and get voted in when 80% of the team members allow. A team may choose to “recruit” if they think a player can contribute or “outvote” a player if a player is not contributing. The players are also allowed to change their teams and bring all their points along. The competition is built on “point-based economy” and it is encouraged by the game providers. When all players leave a team, the team automatically gets removed from public and archived by Eglence Inc.
- In-game Purchases: Users are allowed in game purchases including binoculars to spot the mission specific flamingos, special flamingos that count for more than one grid point, ice blocks to freeze a mission for 20 seconds when needed, and trading cards to transfer the extra points from some grid cells to the ones without any points.
- Game Completion: The game never ends, meaning that there will always be a more complicated next level. A challenge for Eglence Inc. is to keep the game interesting and engaging for players who have been around for a long time. They make use of big data analytics to make sure the veteran players are still around.

# Overview of the Catch the Pink Flamingo Data Model

The data generation scripts create several log files recording the activities of people playing Catch the Pink Flamingo. This document describes the fields in those log files.

The image below is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Catch the Pink Flamingo game data model.

## Gameplay

Each user is a member of at most one team. When a new user starts playing the game, she is on a team by herself for the first level (i.e., playing the tutorial) and may join a team on subsequent levels.

## Simulation Overview

There are three distinct groups for each user with two main categories to contain these three groups. A user can be:

Category 1: In a Team

Group 1: Playing

Group 2: Not Playing

Category 2: Not in a Team

Group 3: Unassigned

## General User Sessions and Team-assignments

When a user is in a team playing, they have a unique user session that starts when they start playing and ends when they stop playing.

In either case, whenever a user is in a team, they will have a team-assignment recorded when they first joined the team but no more. In other words, when a user is unassigned (not in a team) and joins a team, a team-assignment is recorded.

## Leveling Up and More on User Sessions

Whenever the user is in a team (playing or not playing), they can level up whenever the team finishes playing a level. When they level up, two level-up events are recorded for the team, one for the end of the previous level and the other for the start of the current one.

At the same time, all the users who are playing would end their current session, record it, and start new sessions with updated team_level values.

## Schema of the Graph Database for Chats
The schema of the 6 CSV files used to construct the graph database for chats is described in the table below.

File Name | Description | Example
|:--- | :--- | ---:|
chat_create_team_chat.csv | A line is added to this file when a player creates a new chat with their team. | userid, teamid, TeamChatSessionID, timestamp<br/><br/> 559,48,6288,14567<br/> 876,15,6289,24244<br/> 1166,68,6290,65522
chat_item_team_chat.csv | Creates nodes labeled ChatItems. Column 0 is User id, column 1 is the TeamChatSession id, column 2 is the ChatItem id (i.e., the id property of the ChatItem node), column 3 is the timestamp for an edge labeled "CreateChat". Also creates an edge labeled "PartOf" from the ChatItem node to the TeamChatSession node. This edge has a timeStamp property using the value from Column 3. | userid, teamchatsessionid, chatitemid, timestamp<br/><br/> 1,956,629,963,051,460,000,000<br/> 2,081,629,663,111,460,000,000<br/> 1,166,629,063,161,460,000,000
chat_join_team_chat.csv | Creates an edge labeled "Joins" from User to TeamChatSession. The columns are the User id, TeamChatSession id and the timestamp of the Joins edge. | userid, TeamChatSessionID, teamstamp<br/><br/> 559,628,812,345<br/> 876,628,915,468<br/> 1,166,629,015,648
chat_leave_team_chat.csv | Creates an edge labeled "Leaves" from User to TeamChatSession. The columns are the User id, TeamChatSession id and the timestamp of the Leaves edge. | userid, teamchatsessionid, timestamp<br/><br/> 124,468,211,464,241,000.00<br/> 107,468,381,464,243,000.00<br/> 35,067,771,464,246,600.00
chat_mention_team_chat.csv | Creates an edge labeled "Mentioned". Column 0 is the id of the ChatItem, column 1 is the id of the User, and column 2 is the timeStamp of the edge going from the chatItem to the User. | ChatItem, userid, timeStamp<br/><br/> 63,492,508<br/> 63,662,491<br/> 6,371,104
chat_respond_team_chat.csv | A line is added to this file when player with chatid2 responds to a chat post by another player with chatid1. | chatid1, chatid2, timestamp<br/><br/> 6,326,630,521,564<br/> 6,364,632,654,544<br/> 6,371,636,654,567

Each of the 6 CSV files was loaded into Neo4j using the LOAD CSV command that reads each row of the file and then assigns the imported values to the nodes and edges of the graph.  

For example, the code below loads the nodes and values from chat_join_team_chat.csv.  Each row in this file has 3 values: userid, TeamChatSessionID and teamStamp.  As the code reads each row of the file, it merges the imported value from the first column with a node of the type “User”, the value from the second column with a node of the type “TeamChatSession” and the value from the third column with an edge of the type “timeStamp”.  The code also specifies that this edge links each User to the User’s TeamChatSession.

```GraphQL
LOAD CSV FROM "file:///chat-data/chat_join_team_chat.csv" AS row 
MERGE (u:User {id: toInteger(row[0])}) 
MERGE (c:TeamChatSession {id: toInteger(row[1])}) 
MERGE (u)-[:Join{timeStamp: row[2]}]->(c)
```
